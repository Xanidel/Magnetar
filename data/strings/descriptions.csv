Long ago, there was a legendary man only known as SsethTzeentach. Born in a virtual reality called Yooba-Tuba, he was the greatest soldier in the child-only army called the Elite Browser Snakes. “ Explore the Cosmos™ | Ruin Everything™ “, he’d say.

There was also this other legendary modder known as MrDavidhoff. He created the Omega-class Ultra Dreadnought, the largest and most over-fluxed monstrosity of its time... I had to change that class name so it wouldn’t conflict with story lore spoilers...

I think Sseth would be proud. “I don’t have to explain shit.”, he’d say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
